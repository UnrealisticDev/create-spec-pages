# create-spec-pages

This is a short utility that was written as part of the [Spectacle](https://github.com/UnrealisticDev/Spectacle) project, the first global Unreal Engine 4 specifier search. In the spirit of community, Spectacle allows peers to contribute analysis on individual specifiers. This tool iterates over all specifier entries hosted on Contentful and creates corresponding working files in the destination folder.
